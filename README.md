# Halftone
Processing script to generate halftone SVGs for plotting

=> Installation
1: Create a folder named "halftoneDots" in your Processing "sketchbook" folder
2: Download and copy the two *.pde files into this folder
3: Create a "data" folder in this folder, store any image files you want to process in this data folder
4: Edit the input file names in the script to match the ones you've used
5: Edit the output file names to what you need

Note: if you want a CMYK halftone set it's probably a good idea to make sure you know which is which on both input and output

=> Running
Open Processing, you should see the sketch in your sketchbook
Run, the code will generate status messages in the console which might tell you if anything is going wrong
By default the code will run and then close automatically, if you don't want this comment out the "exit()" function
